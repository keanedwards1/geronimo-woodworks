                        <p>By the time year 12 rolled around I was fortunate to begin working weekends in construction on a friend's father's remodeling project that was under way.&nbsp; And this wasn't just any remodeling project, it was one remodeling structure composed of four hyperbolic parabolas - it fascinated me and made me want to make something like it one day - I just didn't yet know how.</p>

                        <h2>More than just hyperbolic</h2>
                        <p>The concept of a hyperbolic parabola is simple enough: A compound curve formed by straight lines. It was the experience of working on the roof that pushed my creative mind to work overtime. It appeared at first in the backs of my earlier rocking chairs, and continued to the same twisted compound curves in the fronts of my desks. </p>

                        <p>In my senior year of high school, we were given a month off to work in the community.  It was the opportunity I was waiting for.  I met Art Espenet Carpenter in 1970 and was transfixed by his shop and his work, so I set up a shop in my bedroom and began making furniture with whatever tools I could find.</p>

                        <h2>Naturally Pushing the Limits</h2>
                        <p>Espenet was of the belief that if someone was motivated enough they would learn what they needed as they went along. Being that I was 19 and already knew everything, I wasn't afraid of taking on the challenge of learning - an early desk I made shows this. In fact, I deliberately made projects as difficult as possible, a habit I still make use of to some degree today.</p>

                        <p>Espenet was very practical in his advice to me in those years.  He said it was fine that I was making furniture, but I had better pay close attention to who was going to buy it since I would soon run out of space to store the finished pieces.</p>

                        <p>During the 70's I was developing techniques to achieve designs I had in mind. In doing that I let the technique dictate the designs. I also became involved in the idea of making multiple pieces in a series, in an attempt to make the production process more efficient. I used more complex jigs and templates, and improved the quality of the pieces.</p>
