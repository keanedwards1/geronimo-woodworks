                        <p>By the time year 12 rolled around I was fortunate enough to begin working weekends in construction on a friend&apos;s father remodeling project that was under way. This wasn't just any remodel, but a structure composed of four hyperbolic parabolas - it fascinated me and stuck with me to this day.</p>

                        <p>The concept of a hyperbolic parabola is simple enough; a compound curve formed by straight lines. It was the experience of working on the roof that pushed my creative mind to work overtime. It appeared, at first, in the backs of my earlier rocking chairs, and continued in the same twisted compound curve seen in the fronts of my desks.</p>

                        <h2>Art</h2>
                        <p>In 1970 my senior year of high school, we were given a month off to work in the community. It was the opportunity I was waiting for. I traveled up to Bolinas to met Art Espenet Carpenter and was transfixed by the shop and his work. Espenet was of the belief that if someone was motivated enough they would learn what they needed as they went along. Upon hearing this, I set up a shop in my bedroom and began making furniture with whatever tools I could find.</p>

He said it was fine that I was making furniture, but I had better pay close attention to who was going to buy it since I would soon run out of space to store the finished pieces.<br><br> Another pearl of wisdom, one I hold to with great appreciation, is this; "The mark of a good craftsman is how well he covers up his mistakes.”</p>

                        <p>During the 70's I was developing techniques to achieve designs I had in mind. In doing that I let the technique dictate the designs. I also became involved in the idea of making multiple pieces in a series—an attempt to make the production process more efficient. This is evident in both my “desk series” and “rocking chair series”.<br><br> I used more complex jigs and templates, and improved the quality of the pieces, plus continually changing the designs and jigs along the way.</p>
